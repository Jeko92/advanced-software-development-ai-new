# TypeScript Basics - Compiling Typescript

Typescrpt has one mayor drawback: the browser or Node.js cannot run your `.ts`
files directly, because runtime engines only understand JavaScript, not
TypeScript syntax. Instead, the Typescript code needs to be transformed into
JavaScript first. This is the process performed by the so called typescript
compiler `tsc`. During transpilation, the compiler checks types, reports
problems, and finally creates the JavaScript output. Type information helps
during development, but it is erased before runtime, which is why TypeScript
gives you stronger feedback without adding runtime overhead.

There are three compilation workflows worth knowing from day one. The first is
file-level compilation, useful for quick experiments and small examples. The
second is project-level compilation driven by `tsconfig.json`, which is how real
projects stay consistent. The third is watch mode, which removes manual
repetition by recompiling on save so your feedback loop stays fast while coding.
If you understand these three workflows, you can move from writing TypeScript to
executing JavaScript reliably, and you can explain exactly why the build output
looks the way it does.

## TypeScript toolchain

Install the compiler so the `tsc` command is available in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g ts
tsc -v
```

The first command installs the compiler, and the second verifies that your
environment can execute it.

## Compiling a typescript file

In order to create an executeable JavaScript file, you need to compile your
TypeScript source file into JavaScript. The `tsc` command line tool does just
that:

```bash
tsc app.scripts
node app.scripts
```

`tsc app.ts` emits `app.js` beside the source file. Running `node app.js`
executes the compiled JavaScript.

When you pass a file directly to `tsc`, it ignores any `tsconfig.json` present
in the project (you learn about the tsconfig in the next chapter). Default
compiler settings apply, which means strict checks are off and module handling
may differ from your project config. This is fine for quick throwaway scripts,
but any code meant to run inside a real project structure should use project
compilation instead.

Given this source file:

```typescript
// app.scripts
const shelterName: string = "Sunflower Commons";
const catCount: number = 7;

function displayShelterInfo ( shelterName: string, catCount: number ): void {
  console.log(`${shelterName} has ${catCount} cats.`);
}
```

The compiler emits this JavaScript:

```javascript
// app.scripts
const shelterName = "Sunflower Commons";
const catCount = 7;

function displayShelterInfo(shelterName, catCount) {
  console.log(`${shelterName} has ${catCount} cats.`);
}
```

The type annotations are stripped entirely. The emitted file is plain JavaScript
with no trace of TypeScript syntax.

## Project compilation

Typically, you want to compile a whole project at once. To do so, you need to
use a `tsc` command with a `tsconfig.json` file.

```bash
tsc
```

Running `tsc` without arguments triggers a `tsconfig.json` lookup. The compiler
searches from the current directory upward until it finds one. Once found, it
reads the `include`, `exclude`, and `compilerOptions` fields to determine what
to compile and how.

## Watch mode

Use watch mode for continuous feedback while editing:

```bash
tsc --watch
```

You can also use the short flag:

```bash
tsc -w
```

Watch mode keeps the compiler process alive and monitors the file system for
changes to any included `.ts` file. When a change is detected, it recompiles
only what is affected rather than rebuilding the entire project from scratch.
Type errors are printed inline in the terminal as they appear, so you get
feedback without manually re-running the compiler after every save.

This is the recommended mode during active development. You leave it running in
a terminal pane and it reports problems as you write code, turning the compile
step into a continuous background check rather than a manual gate.
